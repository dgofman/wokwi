## Code Overview

The following files provide the code for the LCD display and hardware abstraction:

### Oled.c

This file contains functions to initialize and control the OLED display. It includes functions for setting the cursor, drawing characters, and clearing the display.

### Oled.h

This header file defines the function declarations for interacting with the OLED display. It contains declarations for initializing, setting the cursor, drawing characters, and turning the display on or off.

### OledDriver.c

This file implements the lower-level functions for controlling the display. It provides functions for sending data to the display, configuring pins, and sending commands.

### OledDriver.h

This header file defines the function prototypes for the OLED driver, including the necessary pin mappings and OLED commands.

## Simulation Environment

To simulate the project on Wokwi, you must:

1. Ensure you have created a Wokwi project and set up the `wokwi.toml` and `platformio.ini` files.
2. Use **STM32Cube framework** for the Nucleo F411RE.
3. Implement the pin mappings and I2C configuration for the LCD1602 module.

## Pin Mappings and Connections

- **PA2** and **PA3** are used for serial communication with a connected serial monitor.
- The other pins are used to control the LCD1602 I2C display.

## Building and Running

1. **Clone the project** or use the provided URL to access it on Wokwi.
2. **Compile the project** using PlatformIO:
   ```bash
   pio run
   ```
3. **Upload and simulate** the project in the Wokwi environment:
- After building the firmware, use the wokwi CLI or web interface to start the simulation.

## Notes
- The Oled functions are adapted for a 4-bit parallel interface for the LCD1602 module.
- The simulation supports basic operations like turning the display on/off and printing characters to the screen.

## Conclusion
This simulation demonstrates how to interface an LCD1602 I2C module with an STM32 Nucleo F411RE board using Wokwi and the STM32Cube framework. Itâ€™s an excellent way to test and experiment with STM32 microcontroller setups before implementing them in hardware.
